Abstract<br>
<br>
The report argues that plant-based proteins cannot be ignored in the fight against climate change. Human behavior plays a crucial role in both causing and responding to global climate change. The foods we eat have different environmental impacts, with plant-based sources requiring fewer resources than animal-meat. However, for companies to market plant-based protein to consumers we need to understand how branding affects consumers purchasing decisions. To this end it was studied to what extent different branding strategies effect the willingness to pay for plant-based protein menu items in Uganda. The study concludes that framing menu items as meat free reduces willingness to pay significantly, compared to branding that focuses on the general attributes of a menu item. There also seems a predisposition in the sample to value branding that emphasizes environmental impacts.
